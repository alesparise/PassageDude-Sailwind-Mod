**Features:**  
• Adds a system that allows the player to buy passage to different port, for a (pretty high) fee.  

**Configuration notes:** You can adjust a multiplier for the prices of global passages and local passages separately from the configuration file.  
**Passage system explanation:**  
• You can find a PassageDude stand in most ports, they always have an orange canvas and an orange banner that is easy to spot;  
• Clicking on the book on the PassageDude table will open a small UI, read it and click the only button to open the full passage UI;  
• The passage ui is ~~copied from~~ similar to the mission UI. There is a local and a world tab showing the passage offers from the current port;  
• Minor islands will have fewer offer available and no passages to other islands;  
• Major ports will have more offer and inter archipelago passages. Oasis and Happy Bay only have world passages and no local passages;  
• Offer expire 1 day after they are generated (local offers) or 2 days after (global offers);  
• You can only travel to and from island that have a PassageDude available (list below);  
• When selecting a passage offer, you can see some relevant informations:  
	• Distance;  
	• Cost;  
	• Time;  
	• Risk;  
• Cost is based on the distance and on the boat used, and has some random fluctuations;  
• Time is given in a range. Whether the passage is going to take more or less time in this range is based on the risk. Higher risk means a longer passage is more likely; 
• A passage going against the trade winds will also take a little longer than one goind with the trade winds;   
• Risk is based on distance, on the archipelagos crossed and on the boat chosen.  
• As an example, the brig is the safest boat, but also the most expensive one to travel on. The junk is faster, but slightly more risky.  
  
**NOTE:** Passages are really expensive as I imagined this mods for a late game situation, however they can be adjusted from the configuration file.
